# YouTube Content Recommendator API

This repo will host all of the backend code related to fetching Youtube Content in order to showcase on the front-end (comming soon).

The API will handle the RESTful requests sent to the front-end and will communicate the data from Elasticsearch. 

The Content-Engine is responsible for pulling data from YouTube and uploading it properly in Elasticsearch amd maintaining content in Elasticsearch.
